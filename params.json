{"body":"Brownian\r\n================================\r\n\r\nBrownian is a web interface for viewing and interacting with [Bro IDS](http://bro-ids.org/) logs. Try it out on a [live demo](http://brownian.bro-ids.org/?time=all).\r\n\r\nWhy Brownian?\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nBrownian motion relates to the elastic collisions and random motion of particles. Brownian aims to help you leverage Bro and ElasticSearch to make sense of a massive amount of seemingly random data.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis interface only works with Bro if you're using the new [ElasticSearch Logging](http://git.bro-ids.org/bro.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/logging-elasticsearch.rst) plugin.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to that documentation for getting ElasticSearch setup, and receiving logs.\r\n\r\nIt's also *highly* recommended to review the [ElasticSearch configuration tips](https://github.com/grigorescu/Brownian/wiki/ElasticSearch-Configuration).\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* Python version 2.6 or 2.7.\r\n* Brownian comes with it's own webserver, for testing purposes.\r\n* For production use, Apache with mod_wsgi is recommended.\r\n\r\nVirtualenv Setup\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nIt is advised to run Brownian in a [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html) - an isolated Python environment with its own set of libraries.\r\nThis will prevent system upgrades from modifying the globally installed libraries and potentially breaking Brownian.\r\n\r\n1. Download the latest [virtualenv.py](https://raw.github.com/pypa/virtualenv/master/virtualenv.py).\r\n+ Create and switch to your environment:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ python ./virtualenv.py Brownian\r\n$ cd Brownian\r\n$ source ./bin/activate\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/grigorescu/Brownian.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe files are installed in ./lib/python2.X/site-packages/Brownian.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1. Change ```ELASTICSEARCH_SERVER``` in Brownian/lib/python2.X/site-packages/Brownian/settings.py to your server's hostname and port.\r\n+ Change ```TIME_ZONE``` in settings.py to your desired timezone.\r\n+ Review the other settings at the top of settings.py and configure them as desired.\r\n\r\nRunning the Development Server\r\n------------------------------\r\n```bash\r\n$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=Brownian.settings\r\n```\r\nIn settings.py, modify the ```DATABASES``` setting to the path you'd like a small SQLite database created (your user will need write permissions to both the file and the parent directory).\r\n```bash\r\n$ python ./bin/django-admin.py syncdb\r\n$ python ./bin/django-admin.py runserver\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the Production Server with Apache\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n1. Install mod_wsgi\r\n+ Edit ```BROWNIAN_PATH``` at the top of Brownian/lib/python2.X/site-packages/Brownian/wsgi.py to the location of your virtualenv directory.\r\n+ In settings.py, modify the ```DATABASES``` setting to the path you'd like a small SQLite database created (your Apache user will need write permissions to both the file and the parent directory).\r\n+ To create the database, in your virtualenv, run ```./bin/django-admin.py syncdb```.\r\n+ Edit your Apache config to include:\r\n\r\n```conf\r\nWSGIPassAuthorization on\r\nWSGIScriptAlias \"/Brownian\" \"/opt/Brownian/lib/python2.X/site-packages/Brownian/wsgi.py\"\r\n\r\n# Static content - CSS, Javascript, images, etc.\r\nAlias /static/ /opt/Brownian/lib/python2.X/site-packages/Brownian/view/static/\r\n<Directory /opt/Brownian/lib/python2.X/site-packages/Brownian/view/static>\r\n  Order allow,deny\r\n  Allow from all\r\n</Directory>\r\n\r\n# Optional - Permissions\r\n<Directory /opt/Brownian/lib/python2.X/site-packages/Brownian>\r\nAllow from ...\r\n... Blah blah ...\r\n</Directory>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, restart Apache, and you should be good to go.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to have your static files somewhere other than ```/static```, change ```STATIC_URL``` in settings.py. Please make sure to leave a trailing slash.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/\r\n\r\nIssues\r\n------\r\n\r\nIf you see something that's broken, or something that you'd like added, please create an issue.\r\n\r\nAs always, fork, patch, and push away!\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A web interface for interacting with your Bro IDS logs.","name":"Brownian","note":"Don't delete this file!
